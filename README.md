# stocktrading
Assistant software for stock traders, written in Java

This program was written in about 2006( or 2007?),similar to currency trading(another project in this repos). But I can't run it now, because it requires oracle jdeveloper xylayout API. This library is missing. I wish I can find this library in the future.
